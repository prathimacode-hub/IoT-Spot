# Heart Beat Monitor System
## Aim
To Make a Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino.

## Purpose
To learn the working of multiple push buttons and LCD.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- LCD 
- resistor
- Push buttons
- Wires

## Short Description 
- It is a Voting System made by using push buttons for voting and an LCD screen to display results after clicking result button.
## Workflow of the Project
- Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino
- When buttons are pressed, the value variable associated with respective button will increase by one. And your vote will be counted. 
- After Clicking on result button, Result will be displayed on LCD screen. 
## Setup Instructions
- Use Tinkercad 
- setup circuit as shown
- use the code 
- start simulation
- click on any of first four buttons to give button.
- Press on last button after voting tto see results.
- Get the results shown on LCD.
