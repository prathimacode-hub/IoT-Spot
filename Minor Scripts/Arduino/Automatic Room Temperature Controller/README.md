# Project/Script Name
Automatic Room Temperature Controller Circuit simulation on Tinkercad

## Aim

To make automatic room temperature controller circuit simulation in Tinker Cad.


## Purpose

Circuit will try to maintain the room temperature between the lower and hinger temperature using heater and cooler.


## Components Required

List out the components used in your project
* Arduino UNO R3
* Motor
* LED
* Breadboard
* Potentiometer
* LCD Display
* NPN Transistor
* Resistor
* Diode
* Jumper Wires
* USB (TinkerCad if USB not available)
* Temperature Sensor

## Workflow of the Project
In this circuit we are maintaing the room temperature between 20-35 C using motor as cooler and led as heater. If the temperature is lower than 20 C then heater will turn on. Once the temperature gets normal it will turn off. Same thing will happen replacing heater from cooler, if room temperature is greater than 35 C than cooler will turn on, Once the temperature gets normal it will turn off.
User can set the range of room temperature by changing in the code.


## Setup instructions

* Open Tinker Cad on any browser and make the circuit as shown [here](https://github.com/rk18venom/IoT-Spot/blob/Other/Minor%20Scripts/Arduino/Automatic%20Room%20Temperature%20Controller/Images/circuit_diagram.png).
* Then paste the code in code section.
* Open the Serial Monitor.
* Start Simulation.

## Compilation Steps
There is not any error on running the code. It will run perfectly fine.
