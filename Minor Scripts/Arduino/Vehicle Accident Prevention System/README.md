# Vehicle Accident Prevention System


## Aim

To design a Arduino Based Vehicle Accident Prevention System.


## Purpose

This project proposes a quite efficient way to prevent road accidents.


## Components Required

* Arduino UNO
* Breadboard
* Connecting Wires
* LCD 
* Potentiometer 
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Servo Motor
* Buzzer
* 1 Red LED
* 1 Green LED
* 2 Resisitors

## Short Description 

The project deals with prevention of accident by sending alarm and a warning message to the driver if there are other vehicles in the vicinity. It also has a feature of automatic breaking system which turns on when any vehicle is too close than the given threshold distance.

## Workflow of the Project

- The servo motor acts like the breaking system of the vehicle.
- When vehicle is greater than 3m greater than the subject:
  - Green LED is turned on.
  - **Safe Distance** message is displayed on the LCD screen.
- When vehicle is lesser than 3m and greater than 1.5m close to the subject:
  - Green LED is turned on.
  - **Caution Message** is displayed on the LCD screen.
-  When vehicle lesser than 1.5m and greater than 1m close to the subject:
    - Red LED is turned on.
    - **Apply Break** message is displayed on the LCD screen.
- When vehicle is less than 1m from the subject:
  - Automatic Brakes are applied.
  - Green LED is turned on.
  - **Brakes Applied** messsage is displayed on the LCD screen.
