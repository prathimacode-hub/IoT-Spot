# Aim
To detect the Voltage
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the changing voltage at real time
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mentioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the analog input with the help of A0 pin in arduino uno.The values are mapped from 0-5V subsequently. Further we display the voltage in lcd display as well as serial port for every 0.1 second interval.<br>With the help of analog input variety of values could be taken hence we use analog input.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values of Potentiometer to know the voltage at real time.

# Output

Output video and images is added in the /images folder
