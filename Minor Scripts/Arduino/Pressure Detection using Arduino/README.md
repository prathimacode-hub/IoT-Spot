# Pressure Detection using arduino
## Aim
To Measure pressure using force sensor
## Purpose
To Learn the working of force sensor with arduino board.
## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LCD 16*2
- Force Sensor
- Wires
- Breadboard
- Resistors 

## Short Description 
- When simulation started , force sensor detects pressure and gives output.

## Workflow of the Project
- Force sensor is a device which can detect mechanical force like load, weight, tension, compression or pressure.
- When power is given to force sensor, it converts that electrical force into mechanical force such as pressure.
- Hence pressure is detected.
## Setup Instructions
- Use tinkercad
- build the circuit as shown
- write the code as given
- start simulation
- see the result on lcd
