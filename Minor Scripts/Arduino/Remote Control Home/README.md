# Remote Control For Home
## AIM:
Remote Control Home Simulation using Tinkercad

## Purpose:
To Start the Particular light Bulb and Fan Of the Home Using Arduino.

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- Led Bulb
- Fan
- IR Sensor
- IR Remote 
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise Signal PIN, Voltage and IR Pin.
- We initiate a setupPin Function For initialising the Button.
- ToggleLED Function to turn on and if it is turned on then it will be turned Off.
- Switch Case Statement For Initialising the Function of each Button

Remote Control Home is made using the IR sensor we design the Code for that and each switch is assiciated to with the pin that perform particular function and each pin is connected to some load (like Bulb Fan etc.) theIr Remote beams the radiotion that is being captured by the IR sensor and then the arduino using code assiciates the pin and turn them on in if it is off Or off if it is Already Turned On.

## Setup instructions:
- Open Tinker Cad on any browser and make the circuit as shown here.
- Then paste the code in code section.
- Open the Serial Monitor.
- Start Simulation.
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Upload the code provided [here]()
- Run to see the project in action!
