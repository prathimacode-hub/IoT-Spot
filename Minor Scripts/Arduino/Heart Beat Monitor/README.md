# Heart Beat Monitor System
## Aim
To Measure the pulse rate in BPM and print on serial monitor
## Purpose
To monitor Heartbeat.
Heartbeat Sensor is an electronic device that is used to measure the heart rate i.e. speed of the heartbeat. 
Monitoring heart rate and blood pressure are the basic things that we do in order to keep us healthy.
## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- Heart Beat Sensor
- Pot
- DC Voltmeter
- Virtual Terminal 
- Wires

## Short Description 
When we start simulation, it will firstly print pulse sensor started on virtual terminal.
-Then as we increse or decrese the voltage on pot(potentionmeter), the BPM will be printed accordingly.

## Workflow of the Project
-A simple Heartbeat Sensor consists of a sensor and a control circuit. The sensor part of the Heartbeat Sensor consists of an IR LED and a Photo Diode placed in a clip. As the voltage is changedin the test pin, heartbeat sensor will detect it as a pulse has occured. and will print bpm.

## Setup Instructions
- Use Proteus. Download heartbeatsensor Library.
- Use Arduino IDE for programming.
- Make the circuit as seen in the images.
- Run the source code on IDE.
- copy the path .HEX file path generated on terminal.
- click on arduino in circuit. paste the HEX file path on program files.
- click OK.
- click on HeartBeatSensor. upload HEX file from hearbeatsensor library in program file.
- Start simulation.
- try changing voltage on pot.
- See the results.
- Type 4 digits/letters in keypad, see the results.
