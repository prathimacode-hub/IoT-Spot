# Pedestrian Traffic Signal System using Arduino
## Aim
To make a Pedestrian Traffic Signal System using Arduino with LED's
## Purpose
To provide signals to pedestrians, hence letting them know when it's safe to cross the road.
## Requirements

- Arduino Board
- LED's
- Jumper Wires/Connectors
- USB Cable
## Workflow of the Project
- Pins on the arduino boards are assigned for different LED's of Different colors.
- Everytime the loop runs, it checks the state of the push button. If the push button is pushed, then the pedestrian signal gets activated.
- If its not pushed, then the normal traffic lights continue to glow at regular time intervals. 
- Hence suitable signals for crossing can be provided to the pedestrians depending on the interval of the traffic lights glowing.
## Setup Instructions
- Build the circuit as shown
- Write the code as given
- Make sure to connect the GND and VCC Pins appropriately.
