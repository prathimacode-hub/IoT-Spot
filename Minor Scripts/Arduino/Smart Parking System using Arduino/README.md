# Aim
To detect the Vehicle and assist the vehicle at the parking slot
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the parking slot availability
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Ultrasonic Sensor
Infrared Sensor
Servo Motor
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mentioned in the '/images/'<br>
We use the Infrared and Ultrasonic sensor. The use of infrared sensor is to detect the presence of vehicle and update the count accordingly. One infrared sensor is used to take count for vehicle's coming into the parking slot while other is used to check for exit purpose. The use of Ultrasonic sensor is to guide the vehicle at the parking slot to avoid any unnecessary damage. Use of buzzer for same is used as a saftey parameter.

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for Infrared and Ultrasonic sensor to know the gist of the project.

# Output
