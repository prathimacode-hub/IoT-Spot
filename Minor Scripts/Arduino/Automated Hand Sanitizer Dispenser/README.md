# Aim
To detect the distance and dispense sanitizer automatically
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful in ongoing pandemic of Covid-19.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Resistor 1 kilo-ohms
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Servo Motor
LED
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mnetioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the input for ultrasonic distance sensor one for person detection other for checking the fluid level, the sensor which detects the person is setup with few parameters in order to correctly dispense fluid. For that two different functions are mentioned in the code. As soon as sensor detects person it commands to servo motor to rotate, blinks LED and greets the person by welcoming.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for ultrasonic sensor to know the gist of the project.

# Output


<br>

Output video and images is added in the /images folder
