# Visitor counter using arduino

## Aim

To design a calculator using arduino

## Purpose

We will learn how to use manipulate keypad and lcd 


## Components Required
- Arduino Uno Board
- Wires 
- Keypad 4*4
- LCD Screen 16*4
- Resistor
- Wires

## Short Description 

- I am using keypad to take numbers and operator as input from user.
- The program will calculate the result and print it on screen.
- This calculator can perform operations on multiple digit number.


## Workflow of the Project

- When the simultion is started, the keypad will be ready to take inputs.
- if we push any digit button on the keypad, it will take it as first operand till sesond digit is entered.
- If second digit button is pressed before operator button, keypad will consider it as double digit number, and so on.
- Similarly it will happen for second operator. 
- When * button is pressed, the LCD will display the results.


## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press number button on keypad. you will see the numbers printing on lcd.
- Press the character button for operator.
- Press # to see result.
- Press * to reset
