# Visitor counter using arduino

## Aim

To design a calculator using arduino

## Purpose

We will learn how to use manipulate keypad and lcd 


## Components Required
- Arduino Uno Board
- Wires 
- Keypad 4*4
- LCD Screen 16*4
- Resistor
- Wires

## Short Description 

- I am using keypad to take numbers and operator as input from user.
- The program will calculate the result and print it on screen


## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started, and numbers and operator are given as input it will get printed on lcd screen.
- After pressing # , you will see the result.


## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press number button on keypad. you will see the numbers printing on lcd.
- Press the character button for operator.
- Press # to see result.
- Press * to reset
