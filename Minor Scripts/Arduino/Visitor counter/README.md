# Visitor counter using arduino

## Aim

To design a Arduino Based Visitor counter

## Purpose

This low-cost and effective system helps you to keep count of visitors and also buzzes alarm when someone visits which is good for security purpose


## Components Required
- Arduino uno
- Ultrasonic sensor
- LCD 16*2
- resistors
- Piezo
- wires
- Breadboard

## Short Description 

- I'm using a ultrasonic sensor which calculates distance from a certain point.
- When a visitor enter within defined distance, piezo buzzes
- also a variable visits will increase by one considering the buzz of piezo a visit.

## Workflow of the Project

- When simulation is started and we bring an object within defined distance, piezo buzzes.
- When piezo buzzes considering it's state as HIGH (on) a variable which keeps track of number of visitors, increases by one.
- And this number is constantly updated and displayed on LCD screen.


## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Design a circuit as shown in given circuit diagram
- Write the given code.  [code]: https://github.com/vaishnavighiradkar/visitor_counter/blob/main/visitorcounter.ino
- Start simulation
- Try changing the distance on Ultrasonic sensor and try to bring it more closer.
- See the result on scree.
