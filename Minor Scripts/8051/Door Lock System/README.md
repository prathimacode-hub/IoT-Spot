# Aim
Door Lock System using 8051 Microcontroller
<br>

# Purpose
To open and close door through password Authentication
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Proteus 8

AT89C51 Microcontroller

DC Motor

Wires

IC L293D

LCD

Keypad
<br>


# Workflow
keypad is input, LCD displays the action and also displays the input given to microcontroller.
DC motor is the output, we consider DC motor as motion of the door.
Password of door is predefined in the code.
first the input is read, if password given by user matches with the predefined code then the motor rotates clockwise and open the door and after sometime the door closes automatically.
if the password is wrong then Lcd displays that password is wrong and ask the user to try again.
untill the password entered is not right, the door is not opened.


<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image.
Enter the password through keypad
if password entered is correct then door opens and after some time closes by itself.
if password is incorrect it again ask you to try again untill you get the correct password.
