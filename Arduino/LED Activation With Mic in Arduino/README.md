# LED Activation with Mic in Arduino

## AIM:

To control the state of the LED using Mic.

## Purpose:

Implementation of LED Activation with Mic in Arduino

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino UNO
- 1 LED
- 1 Piezo Buzzer
- 1 Resistor
- 1 Push Button Switch
- USB
  (Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:

- We initiate a loop
- We control the Piezo buzzer with the push button switch
- We store the value of the Piezo buzzer(Microphone) and provide it as input to the LED
- Thus by varying the state of the Microphone, we can activate / deactivate the LED.

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of LED,switch and Piezo buzzer to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/shreya024/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/LED%20Activation%20with%20Mic%20in%20Arduino/led_activation_with_mic_in_arduino.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
