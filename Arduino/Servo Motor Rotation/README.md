# Servo Motor Rotation


## Aim

To control a servo motor using Arduino.


## Purpose

To show the working of servo motor and to indicate the maximum rotation by using LED.


## Components Required

- Arduino Uno
- Jumpwires
- Positional Micro Servo motor
- Potentiometer (250 kΩ)
- Resistor (110 Ω)
- Red LED
- External power source 
- Tinkercad (For Simulation)


## Workflow of the Project

The analog pins for potentiometer and LED are initialised as shown in the circuit. The input of the potentiometer is read and scaled to 0-180 degree angle range. 
The LED brightness value is also scaled accordingly and is sent to the LED port. The brightness of LED indicates the amount of rotation of servo motor.


## Setup instructions

- Assemble the circuit in Tinkercad as shown in the circuit diagram.
- The resistor value is set at 110 Ω.
- Upload the code provided in this link.
- Run the simulation and rotate the potentiometer to get the desired motor rotation.
