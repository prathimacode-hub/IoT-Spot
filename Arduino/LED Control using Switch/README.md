# LED Control Using Switch

## AIM:

To turn on and turn off the LED alternatively using Switch

## Purpose:

On or Off State of LED can be controlled using the switch.

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino UNO
- 1 LED
- 1 Pushbutton switch
- 2 Resistors
- USB
  (Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:

- First we initialise LED as output and switch as input
- We initiate a loop
- Using conditional statements we control the state of the LED depending on the state of the switch.

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of both LED and switch to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/pragyakhanna11/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/LED%20Control%20using%20Switch/led_control_using_switch.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
