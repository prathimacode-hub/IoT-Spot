# Visitor counter using arduino

## Aim

To design a circuit which controlls LED light using IR remote

## Purpose

We will learn how to use IR remote


## Components Required
- Breadboard
- LED light (Red)
- Arduino Uno
- IR sensor
- IR Remote
- Resistors
- Wires

## Short Description 

- I am using a IR remote whose inpute will be getting by IR sensor. 
- When a POWER ON/OFF button will be pressed , the LED will change it current state.
- That is if it is ON, it will turn OFF. And if it is OFF/ it will be turned ON.

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started, and power button on the IR remote is pressed, IR sensor will detect which button was pressed.
- If it was detected as the power button, then the LED will change it's state.
## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press the red power button on IR remote.
- Observer changes on LED light.
