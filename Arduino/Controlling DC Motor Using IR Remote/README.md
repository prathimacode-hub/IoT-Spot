# Controlling direction of DC motor using IR remote.

## Aim

To Control rotational direction of dc motor using IR remote.

## Purpose

We will learn how to use manipulate DC motor using IR remote and IR sensor.


## Components Required
- IR remote
- IR sensor
- Breadboard
- DC motor
- Arduino UNO
- Wires
- H-bridge Motor Driver



## Short Description 

- I have used IR remote to take input from user. IR sensor will detect the input.
- According to what button is pressed i.e, next(>>|) or previous(|<<), the DC motor will change it's direction. 

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started, and any one of previous and next button is pressed the DC motor changes it's direction      accordingly.
- If next button is pressed, it will rotate clockwise. And if previous button is pressed, it will rotate anti-clockwise.


## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press the next button on IR remote
- Observe rotational direction of DC motor
- Now, press the previous button on IR remote
- Observe the change in direction of DC motor.
