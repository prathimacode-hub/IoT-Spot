# Printing IR remote input on LCD screen.

## Aim

To print IR remote input on LCD screen.

## Purpose

We will learn how to use IR Remote with LCD screen.


## Components Required
- LCD Screen 16*2
- IR Remote
- IR Sensor
- Resistor
- Arduino UNO
- Breadboard
- Wires
- Potentiometer


## Short Description 

- I am using an IR remote to take input, IR sensor to store and identify the input and LCD screen to print it.

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started and any button on IR remote is pressed, we can see the corresponding output on LCD screen. 

## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press any button
- See the print on LCD screen
