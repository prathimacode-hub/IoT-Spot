# Speeding Motor Using Arduino


## Aim

Social Distance Detector using Arduino.

## Platform Used:
- TinkedCad

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno
- Jumpwires
- Breadboard
- LED
- Resistance (1KΩ)
- Buzzer
- Ultrasonic Detector Sensor


## Workflow of the Project

In this project, we are making social distance detector using arduino. When the distance is less than 100cm,
the buzzer starts beeping and notifying.


## Setup instructions

- Assemble the circuit in Tinkercad as shown in the circuit diagram.
- The resistor value is set at 1K Ω.
- Upload the code provided in this [link]().
- Run the simulation and try to increase the distance in front of ultrasonic sensor.
