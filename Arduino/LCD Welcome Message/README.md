# Aim
To display a welcome message on LCD screen using arduino and notify the user using an alarm
<br>

# Purpose
To show about how a message on LCD looks like
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD screen
Wires
Power source - Laptop or battery
Buzzer
<br>

# Description
Used LiquidCrystal package to configure the LCD. This package makes it easier to operate with the LCD since it consists for many functions like setCursor, print etc.
<br>

# Workflow
A simple message is printed on the LCD after setting the cursor. The first 2 lines are printed on the first row, for the second line, the length of the message is calculated and subtracted from end of the LCD so that the last line fits in the second row. An alarm is added so that the user gets notified before getting the message.
