When raising an issue, do make sure to mention the kind of script, project title, short description of the project and how would you expect it to work. As a good practice, always link the issue number with a pull request. (#issue number: Give these details when you raise a PR).

If you worked on or want to initiate a unique project and share it with the world, you can do that here. Go through the contributing guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)üë©‚Äçüíª

Subsequently, also go through the GitHub documentation on [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).


<h2> Link To The Website</h2>

<h2>üõ†Templates to Follow</h2>

- [Feature request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/.github/issue_template/feature_request.md)
- [Bug Report](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/.github/issue_template/bug_report.md)
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/.github/pullrequest_template.md)
- [README](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md)

**Note**: One should follow these templates while creating a new issue or pull request. 


<h2>üìùProject Structure</h2>

Your projects should contain this flow to maintain similarity across all other projects. Make sure to note these things, before you create a PR.

Create a folder of your project title. (Example: If you want to add a LED blinking using 8051, then the project should be placed under **8051 Scripts** with project title named as "LED Blinking" and file name as "led_blinking.c" if it's a C file)

The project repository you had created would have :

**file_name.py** or **file_name.c** or **file_name.cpp** - This file is the project you have worked upon.

**README.md** - This file is must be included to get a good understanding of the project (Elaborate briefly about how it works using [README](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) template). 

**requirements.txt** - In this file, you should add all the requirements you need to make your project work which also illustrates the list of all components used specifically

**Images** - This folder would have all images added, be it screenshots or step by step process images. Also, the inclusion of block diagrams and emulator circuit diagrams are a must to portray the project efficiently.

Since this repo is purely technical, make sure you include "Block Diagrams" and "Emulator Prototype Circuit Diagrams" in "Images" and direct them to the README.md file

**Related files** - The other additional and related files would be added up in the "Related" folder.


<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Things to Note</h2>

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute the script, it's preferable that you create a new issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in the correct folder.
* Add Screenshots and block diagrams to help us know what this Script is all about. 
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/IoT-Spot/blob/main/README.md).**


<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Workflow:</h2>

- Fork the repository

- Clone your forked repository using terminal or gitbash.

- Make changes to the cloned repository
