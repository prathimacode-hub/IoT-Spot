# LED Blinking using RaspberryPI

## Aim
LED Blinking using RaspberryPI

## Purpose
LED Blinking using RaspberryPI

**Requirements:**
- Rasberry-Pi
- Bread-Board
- Jumper-Wires
- LED
---
## Workflow of the Project

- Upon starting the circuit, the GPIO pins are configured to control the LED.
- The program enters a loop, turning the LED on and off at regular intervals.

## Setup Instructions
- Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to any GND (ground) pin on the Raspberry Pi.
